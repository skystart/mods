<h1><img src="resources/icon.png"/> TTFAutoHint</h1>

Part of the FreeType package,<br/>
original can be found here: http://freetype.sourceforge.net/ttfautohint<br/>

This is the Windows build, portable, no installation, no registry modification.
Enhanced with manifest and HD-icon.

There are <strong>no proper instructions</strong> but this $hitty little description:
<blockquote>
TTFAutoHint provides a 99% automated hinting process <br/>
and a platform for finely hand-hinting the last 1%. <br/>
It is ideal for web fonts and supports many scripts:<br/>
<em> Latin, Greek, Arabic, Devanagari, Hebrew, Khmer, Myanmar, Thai, and many more...</em>
</blockquote>


You can probably figure-out yourself how to use the GUI part,
and use <code>--help</code> for the console application,
but <em>if you wish to have a headache</em> - go ahead and try figure the official docs. at:<br/>
