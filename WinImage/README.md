<h1><img src="resources/icon.png"/> WinImage</h1>

the v9.0.0.9000 x86 - simplified, flat program (no setup/no installation),<br/>
it is not portable since it requires registry keys<br/>
(and will write associations automatically too!)

it is the minimal, 100% working program.

you may or may not run <code>resources/_install.reg</code> to provide some defaults.

the <code>resources/</code> folder has <code>_filedisk.sys_</code> and <code>_filedisk.reg_</code>
if you'll rename the files- removing the <code>_</code> prefix and suffix,
and move them to the program folder, the driver/service will be installed automatically,
(or require running <code>filedisk.reg</code> once)
it is a mock "A:\" drive you can use,

I've found it useless, and the driver might break your Windows.. 
so you better not use it.

<code>_my_key.reg.7z</code> include my personal license,
it is password protected (just for me..)
